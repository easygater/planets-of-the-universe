#### Why use Jekyll?

The main reasons for using Jekyll are efficiency, it eliminates lots of copying and pasting in our websites among other things:

* Makes use of ☛ Markdown to reduce the overhead of HTML,
* Allows sharing of HTML code between pages,
* Has the ability to automatically write repeated HTML,
* Can be hosted on GitHub using GitHub pages.

Jekyll isn’t the only way to get these features, you could use other static site generators or even other languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby. But Jekyll is worth to give a try and to play around. If you don't want to maintain intensively websites and fairly static content fits to your purpose, Jekyll will be your choice.
Another good reason is to create website templates. Since you can you can use double-mustache notation in HTML, like in handlebars and ejs, Jekyll can be used to create the HTML template and easily integrated into your node.js application.
